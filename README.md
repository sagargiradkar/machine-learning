# List of Laboratory Assignments

This repository contains a set of laboratory assignments for Group A, focusing on various machine learning and data analysis techniques. Each assignment is designed to help you gain hands-on experience with different aspects of data analysis, machine learning, and model evaluation. Below, you'll find a brief description of each assignment along with relevant instructions and data sources.

## Assignment 1: Regression Technique

**Objective**: Predict month-wise temperatures in India using linear regression and assess model performance.

1. Download temperature data from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/temperatures-of-india?select=temperatures.csv). The dataset contains average temperatures recorded in Celsius for different places in India, month-wise.

2. Perform the following tasks:
   - Apply Linear Regression using a suitable library function to predict month-wise temperature.
   - Assess the performance of the regression model using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Square metrics.
   - Visualize the simple regression model.

## Assignment 2: Classification Technique

**Objective**: Build a machine learning classifier to predict student admissions based on GRE and academic scores.

1. Download the Graduate Admissions dataset from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/mohansacharya/graduate-admissions). Ensure the target variable "Admitted" is set to 0 or 1.

2. Tasks to perform:
   - Build a classification model using Decision Tree to predict whether a student will get admission or not.
   - Apply data pre-processing techniques such as Label Encoding and Data Transformation if necessary.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Apply a machine learning algorithm.
   - Evaluate the model's performance.

## Assignment 3: Improving Performance of Classifier Models

**Objective**: Implement an SMS Spam Filtering system using a probabilistic approach (Naive Bayes Classifier/Bayesian Network).

1. Download the SMS Spam Collection dataset from [this link](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). The dataset contains SMS messages classified as SPAM or HAM.

2. Tasks to perform:
   - Apply data pre-processing techniques if necessary, such as Label Encoding and Data Transformation.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Apply at least two Machine Learning Algorithms and evaluate their performance.
   - Apply Cross-Validation and compare model performance.
   - Perform Hyperparameter tuning and evaluate models.

## Assignment 4: Clustering Techniques

**Objective**: Identify profitable customer segments for a shopping mall owner using clustering algorithms.

1. Download the customer dataset from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/shwetabh123/mall-customers). The dataset includes customer information such as age, annual income, and spending score.

2. Tasks to perform:
   - Apply data pre-processing techniques, such as Label Encoding and Data Transformation, if necessary.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Apply at least two clustering algorithms based on spending score.
   - Evaluate the model's performance.
   - Apply Cross-Validation and evaluate the model.

## Assignment 5: Association Rule Learning

**Objective**: Find association rules between items in a retail company's transaction records.

1. Download the Market Basket Optimization dataset from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/hemanthkumar05/market-basket-optimization). The dataset contains transaction records with lists of items sold.

2. Tasks to perform:
   - Perform data preprocessing.
   - Generate the list of transactions from the dataset.
   - Train the Apriori algorithm on the dataset.
   - Visualize the list of rules.
   - Experiment with hyperparameter values, especially the minimum confidence value, to generate rules accordingly.
